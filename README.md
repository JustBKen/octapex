## Octave for Physics Experiments
A GNU/Octave package aiming to provide means for quick preliminary analysis of experimental data, with the results exportable for further processing with more sophisticated tools.

Since Octave, being a specialized scripting language, is fairly easy to learn and is more efficient for the tasks it was designed for (numerical work), it seems to be a good choice for a quick model/hypothesis test, preprocessing/visualisation of large amounts of homogenous data, or some quick calculation that booting up something more versatile for would be overkill.
Also a good potential tool to use from phone over ssh... perhaps?

In any case, this code would be usable with Python via oct2py.
