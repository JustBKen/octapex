## Octave for Physics Experiments
A GNU/Octave package aiming to:
- provide a toolkit for calculations necessary in university physics lab work - built primarily according to the needs of HU Berlin's Grundpraktikum
- provide means for quick preliminary analysis of experimental data, with the results exportable for further processing with more sophisticated tools.

Since Octave, being a specialized scripting language, is fairly easy to learn and is more efficient for the tasks it was designed for (numerical work), it seems to be a good choice for a quick model/hypothesis test, preprocessing/visualisation of large amounts of homogenous data, or some quick calculation that booting up something more versatile for would be overkill.
